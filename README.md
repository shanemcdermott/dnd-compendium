# DnD Compendium
The **DnD Compendium** is a student driven project to build an SRD legal (as dictated by Wizards of the Coast) web application for Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition.

# Initial Milestone
The initial milestone is to hold minor player character (PC) data and act as a *spell manager* so players can quickly glance what spells their characters know, have memorized/prepared, have used, and have available -- all along with descriptions of said spells.

# Further Milestones
Further milestones include dungeon masters having access to player credentials to better conduct skill checks like perception and be aware of PC's health and ailments.

# Live Streams
To better document my progress, and to aid in the production of a reflective blog on this experience, I am recording every single minute of development on this project. This allows me to "rubber duck" talk with the audience; be there zero people watching or dozens. Development is slowed up due to general chit-chat, but it makes the development process much more engaging and delightful. It can be seen:
